//! `muser-cluster` — authenticated GX10 disaggregated prefill.
//!
//! Muser does **not** compile CUDA into its Mac binary. The release carries a
//! narrow llama.cpp GX10 adapter and resident muser-prefilld; this crate is
//! the shared control, transport, security, scheduling, and detached-cache
//! receiver implementation. Clean split: CUDA prefill -> authenticated
//! Handoff V2 tiles -> Metal scatter-on-arrival -> atomic commit -> Metal decode.
//!
//! Launch config: 1x M3 Ultra (decode) + 1x NVIDIA GX10/GB10 (prefill). The
//! receiver admits one producer at a time — one control endpoint, one HMAC key
//! id, and a replay ledger keyed per key id — so multiple concurrent prefill
//! nodes are roadmap, not this release.
//!
//! Transport: mTLS-TCP, with a release floor of 3.0 Gbps median effective
//! installed-payload throughput across three handoffs. With the `melon-rdma`
//! feature and an `rdma` section in the cluster config, segment payloads can
//! move over a MelonDMA RoCE bulk lane instead; control, seal and ACK stay on
//! mTLS either way. The ATTO TB5->100 GbE Mac upgrade remains roadmap. Ships
//! the 13 NoPE tiles *during* prefill (position-free -> memcpy-relocatable),
//! and the matching SWA chunks with the last 2048 tokens of CUDA.
//! Gate: >=95% transfer hidden `[target]`.
//!
//! No TTFT multiplier is claimed until the frozen release matrix passes.
