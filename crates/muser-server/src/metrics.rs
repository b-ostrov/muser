//! `GET /snapshot` (poll) + `GET /telemetry` (SSE push) — the dashboard
//! contract. **No direct Ferrite source** — this is muser-original,
//! specified in full by `docs/metrics-schema.md` and
//! `docs/metrics-schema.json` (Draft 2020-12), which this module must
//! satisfy exactly (the dashboard renders entirely from that contract).
//!
//! Emits from `muser-engine`'s live counters + `muser-kvpack`'s
//! `economics` module with no extra bookkeeping: one engine-held state
//! struct (`state::ServerState`), `build_snapshot` serializes all of it.
//!
//! The hero panel this feeds: kvpack cache economics — GB-from-cache vs
//! GB-recomputed = value quantified (`docs/kvpack-economics.md`).
//!
//! ## Status (real-telemetry pass)
//!
//! This module now defines the full `MetricsSnapshot` wire shape and
//! assembles it from real counters where `ServerState` has them (economics,
//! sessions, event log, uptime, request/viewer counts, optionally a real
//! `--model` file size, and committed disaggregation receipts), and
//! clearly-placeholder values elsewhere (node/GPU telemetry and egress) —
//! because those measurements are unavailable. Every section carries an explicit honesty
//! tag in the `_honesty` extension so a live dashboard never has to guess
//! which numbers are real; `docs/telemetry.md` is the field-by-field
//! reference this file must stay in sync with.
//!
//! Unavailable nodes, transfers, and optimizations are emitted as empty
//! collections. The live endpoint never substitutes simulated product data.
